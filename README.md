🔐 Express JWT Authentication API
Secure Authentication • Token-Based Access • Scalable Backend Design
📌 Overview

This repository implements a secure authentication and authorization system using Express.js and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

The project is designed to demonstrate how modern backend applications handle user authentication, protect routes, and manage secure access using token-based authentication. It follows clean architecture principles and real-world backend best practices.

This is not just a login/signup demo — it focuses on security, structure, and scalability.
